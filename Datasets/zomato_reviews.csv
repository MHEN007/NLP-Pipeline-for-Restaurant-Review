The 3rd Floor Bar Stock Exchange,Besides the novelty of fluctuating drink prices and the excellent use of recycled materials for furniture and collection of stuffs to create a marvelous ambience... the place is lively and serves an excellent menu with tasty food... especially the white sauce pasta no Cafe can beat the taste of white sauce pasta.

The staff is polite and friendly..... there only loop hole is the slow service, you need to remind them about your order, which the waiter keeps forgetting or sometimes mixing with others, happened with me quite a few times..Hope they train there staff for quick and apt service. Else the place is great","Mar 10, 2019"
