12,Ravi has served well. thanks

353,"ambience is good, Ganesh sir served us very delicious delicacies."
354,"The food is so so average except their roti, because they are made of wheat instead of maida. The main course is just ordinary. The most important thing is, the cutlery seems very much smelling and having food stains.The waiter and whomsoever suited girl roaming like chilly powder in sweet shop, good for nothing.Completely wastage of money, thank you Zomato for saving my 25%"

374,"This dhaba outlet offers a stunning ambiance, but the food tends to be oily and heavy on spices, which might not be suitable for everyone. Service was sluggish and the cleanliness of the washrooms leaves much to be desired. Overall, while the atmosphere is pleasant, improvements in food quality and service efficiency are needed !"

409,A bad experience here. First it took very long for them to take the order. Then all the drinks i asked for were not available and they tried to push a different drink in name of drink ordered. The delays in everything from taking order to getting the bill and taking payment confirmation all took a very long time.
