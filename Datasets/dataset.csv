327,"Late nite omelletes are not good here, there is no variety!"
328,Everything at Sala Thai is tasty and well-portioned.
329,"Whenever you need a Sushi fix, Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service."

336,I was pretty much full after our fondue appetizer.
337,BE CAREFUL before you request extra spice.
338,The octopus eaters were floored by the Octopus salad.
339,We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods.
340,And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic.
341,I started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two.
342,The sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the rasamalai was forgettable.
343,"We've been following chef Lyle's food around New York for 15 years and while remaining classic, his innovations with bistro fare have made us return and return."

345,it's delicious!

354,Wow over 100 beers to choose from.
355,Be careful of portions - they're HUGE.

357,My first time there I happened not to like the Crab Croquette apt that i ordered and they were happy to change it for me without making no big deal.
358,Did I mention the wine?
359,"Plus, on Wednesday nights the house wine is unlimited!"
360,Even my Indian friend couldn't believe how good and tasty everything was.
361,like saying her bread comes from a special bakery when we have seen her buying it dowtown manhathan.
362,The dim sum servings here are a bit larger than I'm used to.
363,We won't go to this place again for a good meal.
364,"Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed, however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance."
365,Taj Mahal offeres gret value and great food.
366,"But don't ever order bacon late at nite (either platter or in sandwiches, for that matter don't from any take out place) as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacos, hurt my molars."
367,"Outstanding Bagels, but you get what you pay for."

373,I will recommend Scopa to all of my friends for a place to go for wonderful Italian food.
374,"Looking around, I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant, not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen."
375,I really loved the different and inovated touch that's the cheff gives to the food.
376,They came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant.
377,"I had a terrific meal, and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range, instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that wasn't as good."
378,"The food is good, especially their more basic dishes, and the drinks are delicious."
379,But the main hit was the whole grilled fish.

383,Sauce was watery and the food didn't have much flavor.

387,"Not sure where the previous reviewer, lonk, dined, but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food!"
388,"In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food, this is one of the best spots."

393,The food's as good as ever.
394,"The crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly."
395,"the food was undercooked-the sauce watery, and the vegetables raw."
396,And the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating.
397,The sauces used are also not that exciting.
398,The secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered.
399,The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard.
400,We had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses!
401,The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful.
402,"I got the $10 10-piece dim sum combo, every bite of which was great."
403,"If it's just a quick martini at the bar (which I recommend Jeffery's) or a mind blowing Roast Chicken, go to Village!"
404,If you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo.
405,I have never been disappointed but their true strength lays in their amazingly delicious and cheap lunch specials.
406,"So much more than the usual bar food, go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their hand-crafted beers."
407,And its absolutely DELICIOUS.
408,I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine.
409,This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent.
410,"While they keep the capex to a minimum, they do put some cash into the bagels, because they among the best in the city."
411,I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri.
412,"While the place is not a hotspot hangout, the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck."
413,Have frequented 'ino for several years and the food remains excellent.
414,"Their eggplant is so delicate, sweet tender!"
415,"Each bite of food at Kai was indeed delicious, fresh, and elegant."
416,all the food was excellent - considering the quality of food in most moderately priced restaurants is mediocre this was slightly more pricey and well worth it.
417,My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better.
418,"I had the cod with paella (spicy and very filling, I'm a big eater and could only eat half) while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips (again, a big serving - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries)."
419,You should pass on the calamari.
420,"The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless, so was the seafood tagliatelle."

442,The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn't even fully melted!
443,We were very surprised by how good the food was on our first visit here on a Sunday night.
444,"Nha Trang, while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor, horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals, is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been to. the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables."
445,"On the other hand, if you are not fooled easily, you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse, and food that will outshine in presentaion, taste, choice, quality and quantity."
446,"If I could rate the people this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza, sorry - not the best in NYC."
447,The food is amazing!!!!
448,"Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit, but the food was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues."
449,"The portions are now very small, the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good, the restaurant, due to its popularity, seems frantic."
450,"For the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan."
451,"The owner is very friendly and a great guy, go try his pizza, you'll like it!"
452,"With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care."
453,"I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose."
454,The service is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the food arrives.
455,"The bruscetta is a bit soggy, but the salads were fresh, included a nice mix of greens (not iceberg) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen."

468,"The fish was adequate, but inexpertly sliced."
469,"If you live in new york city, you'll find better food at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount."
470,Try the olive cream cheese or the lox spread on a whole wheat everything bagel.
471,"While it's not Nobu, it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full."

513,Food was average but tasty.

532,The menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked.
533,A must for all the Dosa lovers.

557,"BUt their best dish is thh Thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a dish that would cost $23.95 is most places, but it is $16 here."
558,"My husband said the portions were very small, but if my main course was good to eat the portion would've been fine for me."

567,The food was absolutely amazing!!
568,"An excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but, the food was slightly disappointing."
569,Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood.
570,"That is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish, and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste."
571,They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying.
572,All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better!
573,"It is about FOOD and Ambiance, and imagine how dreadful it will be it we only had to listen to an idle engine."
574,The food was good too.
575,"Admittedly, this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate (and thank goodness, in my opinion) but for simple, elegant sushi there is no better place in New York or anywhere in the US."
576,The menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them.
577,The white bean brushetta to start was incredible and the pasta was phenomenal.
578,The rest of the menu is limited by everything is good eats.

589,"After complaining about the chicken dish, the manager came over to tell us that, no one had ever complained before, and that we just didn't know what the dish was supposed to taste like."
590,The food was spicy and delicious.
591,A little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite.
592,"Anyways, if you're in the neighborhood to eat good food, I wouldn't waste my time trying to find something, rather go across the street to Tamari."
593,Dahkin also offers prix fixe lunch and buffet.
594,This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart's and I must say how delicous the food and the service was.
595,Great place to grab a hot bagel on the way to work.
596,"It's like they took leftover chicken, poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it (the sauce was translucent and red)."

600,We've been to Grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed.
601,"The food is very good too but for the most part, it's just regular food, nothing special."
602,A touch more jalapeno heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed.
603,Tried the pad see ew on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it's one of my favorite dishes.
604,"Guacamole+shrimp appetizer was really great, we both had the filet, very good, didn't much like the frites that came with, but the filet was so good, neither of us cared."
605,This food is asian-air fusion.
606,Nothing fancy but really good food with pretty reasonable price.
607,"The chicken pot pie is excpetiona, the cheeseburger huge and delictable, and the service professional wan warm."
608,"While I quite liked the food and the ambience, I'm not quite sure if it they really deserve it the Michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window."
609,Service was good and food is wonderful.
610,The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal

621,"More important, the sushi rivals the best in Tokyo."
622,I have never had cheescake like this.
623,"Fluke sashimi drizzled with jalapeno-lime olive oil, the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish's sweetness."

626,My steak au poivre was one of the worst I've had.
627,"Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh, a delicious and sweet tasting bread."
628,"Although the tables may be closely situated, the candle-light, food-quality and service overcompensate."
629,The food was delicious and the waiter was incredibly helpful and attentive (considering we were the only ones there for the first hour).
630,"From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff, I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it."
631,"Perhaps this food is considered extreme to an Upper East Side resident, but for the rest of us who've actually eaten ethnic food, this is simply dull."
632,Tasty but expensive.
633,"Both are delicious, the cooks are friendly and are willing to take a moment and speak to you and shake your hand."
634,My friend ordered some of their special sushi rolls which had excellent presentation and tasted great!
635,"The staff was accomodating, the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely."
636,"my picks are:  - Scallion Pancake (fried with vegetable juice, very special and tasty)  - Guizhou Chicken  - Shredded Squid Family Style (one of my personal favorites)  - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab  - Shuizhu Fish (this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans, I wouldn't recommend to my American friends as it's very spicy."

638,I really liked the noodle dishes at Rice Avenue compared to their Green Curry dish.
639,I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side.
640,"The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome, great appetizer to share!"

643,"Excellent atmosphere, delicious dishes good and friendly service."
644,A cool place to hang with your friends for a couple of healthy drinks and desserts.

905,"For $760 for 2 people, it's a once in a lifetime experience."

922,"Yes, the prices are high, but I felt it was worth it."
923,"So if you want a nice, enjoyable meal at Montparnasse, go early for the pre-theater prix-fixe."
924,We were fans of the half-price Saturday night option until some inedible squid during a recent visit.

956,"I need at least three rolls to be full, and that's at least $14.00!"
957,"All of it was simply amazing, unique and tasty and best of all it didn't break the bank."
958,"Great wine list, reasonably priced.--Sara"
959,"While the food was excellent, it wasn't cheap (though not extremely expensive either)."
960,The prices and ambience are especially great considering it's in the West Village.
961,"For the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan."
962,"With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care."
963,"The atmosphere isn't the greatest , but I suppose that's how they keep the prices down ."

979,Delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door.
980,"Overall, I'm still impressed that the place even exists and the prices are quite decent but then again, its Chinatown."
981,$20 gets you unlimited sushi of a very high quality- I even took a friend here from Japan who said it was one of the best sushi places in the US that he has been to.
982,Sushi wasn't anything spectacular for the price.
983,"Overall, worht every penny."
984,"Over price, and small portions ."
985,"BUt their best dish is thh Thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a dish that would cost $23.95 is most places, but it is $16 here."
986,It is expensive but well worth the money.
987,The food was very expensive (we spent $160 for lunch for two) but extremely tasty.
988,The all you can eat deal is truly amazing here.
989,"That is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish, and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste."
990,They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying.
991,All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better!
992,"They have it all -- great price, food, and service."
993,"It's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre food, noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks."
994,A little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite.
995,"We actually gave 10% tip (which we have never done despite mediocre food and service), because we felt totally ripped off."
996,The lunch special is an asbolute steal.
997,Nothing fancy but really good food with pretty reasonable price.
998,Not worth the prices.
999,sandwiches tho pricey are over stuffed - can serve 2 persons easily thus cost effective!
1000,"Not cheap, but not that expensive either."
1001,"Spice is sleek, modern and cool with a menu that will not hurt your wallet."
1002,Very affordable and excellent ambient!
1003,"Bill a little high, but worth it."
1004,"If you're looking for a great meal at a decent price, go to Del Frisco's!"
1005,They charge $6.00 for rice.
1006,This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money.
1007,Tasty but expensive.
1008,Although be warned their dinner menu to sit and take out prices are different.
1009,There was a great deal for 6 Blue Point oysters and a beer or glass of wine for $8!
1010,"But for whatever reason, prices are about twice as high."
1011,I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side.
1012,"Only complaint would be that at an average cost of $12-$15 per meal, I'd like not to have to worry about finding a seat!"
1013,Great food and the prices are very reasonable.
1014,"At 5 dumplings for $1, you just cannot go wrong."
1015,But the pizza is way to expensive.
1016,"The food is expensive, but worth every bite."
1017,Dakshin is one of the few affordable and tasty Indian restaurant in the upper east side.
1018,They charge different prices all the time.
1019,"I was in love with Pongsri on 48th, but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced."
1020,We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it.
1021,The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food.
1022,"Top spot in town for Vietnamese classics, better than places that cost a lot more."
1023,The dim sum is delectable while the prices are quite easy on the wallet.
1024,"Overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites, but everything was delicious."
1025,I must say it's a little pricey for the food because it was not as spectacular as the view.
1026,Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $10.
1027,"It's only $1.95 for a regular slice and $4.00 for a slice with a mushroom, not mushrooms."
1028,"$160 for 2 filets, 2 sides, an appetizer and drinks."
1029,"While the prices are nothing special, the portions are huge."
1030,"The menu is Prix Fixe, so be prepared to spend at least $60 per person, but it is Well worth itsuperb food."
1031,I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fine Indian dining experience that is definitely a value for your dollar.
1032,This big draw is the all you can sushi here for $19.95!
1033,we spent 50 $$ definetly will come back with my friends!!!
1034,"came here for restaurant week, didn't save much, but it was still great."
1035,"Not the greatest sushi place, but excellent for a $19.95 all you can eat."
1036,Drinks way over priced.
1037,Moderate prices.
1038,"You get what you pay for and with that logic in mind, Spice is a great place to grab some cheap eats and drinks in a beautiful setting."
1039,"Other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced, the atmosphere is filled with energy (and the beautiful people of course) and the food was surprising good!"
1040,We all felt it was worth it.
1041,The pizza is overpriced and soggy.
1042,"You'll pay at least double at any other Italian restaurant in the city, and most still don't compare."
1043,"For the quality of food, a little too expensive."
1044,IT is the best deal in town for a Monday night dinner at a fine restaurant.
1045,"Also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side."
1046,"This place has good potential, but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else."
1047,And all of that won't break your bank!
1048,Acceptable prices.
1049,"As I made the title, it's an affordable restaurant for great taste."
1050,Definitely not worth the price!
1051,Great food at reasonable prices.
1052,The prices are about $9 for an entree for dinner and even less for lunch.
1053,and you can't beat the prices.
1054,Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant.
1055,"It is terrific, as is the value."
1056,The menu prices are a bit expensive for what you get in quality and portion size.
1057,Could be pricey without a prix fixe meal.
1058,It is also extremely well priced.
1059,"Then, get ripped on free box wine."
1060,"try the spicy shrimp appetizer (again, not the greatest value in the world but worth the price) and the lamb vindaloo is great."
1061,Incredible food at a very agreable price brings me back just about every other day to this authentic Thai restaurant.
1062,A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning!
1063,But the staff was so horrible to us.
1064,Where Gabriela personaly greets you and recommends you what to eat.
1065,"Not only was the food outstanding, but the little 'perks' were great."
1066,Our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken (usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats).
1067,"It took half an hour to get our check, which was perfect since we could sit, have drinks and talk!"
1068,Obviously run by folks who know a pie.
1069,"Best of all is the warm vibe, the owner is super friendly and service is fast."
1070,Faan's got a great concept but a little rough on the delivery.
1071,"From the incredible food, to the warm atmosphere, to the friendly service, this downtown neighborhood spot doesn't miss a beat."
1072,The price is reasonable although the service is poor.
1073,The place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious.
1074,They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another.
1075,"Whem asked, we had to ask more detailed questions so that we knew what the specials were."

1080,One thing I liked about this place is that I never felt rushed or pressured to give up my table ot incoming guests.
1081,"Everyone I have spoken too there is super friendly, helpful, and willing to the extra mile for a customer."
1082,They are often crowded on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their service.
1083,"The atmosphere is unheralded, the service impecible, and the food magnificant."
1084,"The wait staff is friendly, and the food has gotten better and better!"
1085,I've never been treated so rudely.
1086,I also ordered for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the order.
1087,Our server checked on us maybe twice during the entire meal.
1088,"Had we been stalling I could understand where they were coming from, but we had been there less than an hour and they hadn't even brought us a check yet!"
1089,"I have tried to make reservations, but both times, the hostess didn't have my name."
1090,Overall A oh ya even though there is waiting it is deff worth it
1091,"From the terrible service, to the bland food, not to mention the unaccommodating managers, the overall experience was horrible."
1092,Service is highly refined: our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress.
1093,"Other than the crappy service from two individuals, it's great."
1094,You are treated just like royality.
1095,The food always tastes fresh and served promptly.
1096,"Pizza and garlic knots are great as well, I order from them quite often and the delivery is always super quick!"
1097,But who says Murray's is anything about service.
1098,"Service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things (the heavy, black, antique-seeming teapot, for one) in the restaurant experience."
1099,"service is friendly, and never had a problem walking in and getting a table."
1100,"First off, the waitress was completely unattentive the 2 times we saw her(odd in a restaurant with 6 tables) and got our order wrong."
1101,"And Kruno, the beverage manager is the best bartender I have yet to come across."
1102,"The food, drinks and service are clearly among the best in the city."
1103,"I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic, alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods, the tastes, the experiance."
1104,"Last time I went here, the waitress didn't come back after taking our order."
1105,"Granted the space is smaller than most, it is the best service you will find in even the largest of restaurants."
1106,The service was attentive and her suggestions of menu items was right on the mark.
1107,"The environment is romantic, but the food is horrible, the service is pathetic, and gabriella lies about everything she could."
1108,The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive.
1109,"If you're craving for Haru's great food, especially the House Roll, but can't stand the wait building outisde, head across the street to their Sake Bar!"
1110,All conveniently delivered right to the door.
1111,Okay service.
1112,The only thing more wonderful than the food (which is exceptional) is the service.
1113,The waitress suggested glasses of wine that went very well with the food.
1114,"They might be all business at the counter when you give your order, but their food says I love you."
1115,"Ok, so the servers wander around a little clueless, but there's more than enough servers for the crowd they get -- it's fine, you just have to make a small effort to get their attention."
1116,The service is awful.
1117,Regardless of whether there are two people or two hundred people ahead of you the hostess will take your name and tell you Five minutes.
1118,They didn't give us the dinner special until we asked for it.
1119,Very good service and very good prices.
1120,"The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu, present your meal, and attend to your needs."
1121,"The most annoying thing, though, is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue."
1122,"The service, wine selection, ambiance are all outstanding and deserve recognition."
1123,It was rather pathetic that it took them over an hour to seat us.
1124,"We were seated promptly as we had reservations, however after that the service was slow."
1125,"It's really also the service, is good and the waiters are friendly."
1126,"I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart's for their food, the ambience and wonderful service."
1127,And it was quick which is very important.
1128,"The menu looked good, except for offering the Chilean Sea Bass, but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside."
1129,"Since it literally is a complete hole in the wall, it's a bit intimidating at first, but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you - don't hesitate to ask for help with what to get."
1130,"When he finally did, he was unable to make a gin and tonic -- couldn't find tonic."
1131,"The service is ok, some of the people didn't get what they asked for."
1132,Staff is very accomodating.
1133,Hurley's is like Cheers where everyone knows your name and they are ACTUALLY glad you came.
1134,"The food was terrific and the service classy, attentive, without being overbearing."
1135,"We have never had any problems with charging the meal or the tip, and the food was delivered quickly, but we live only a few minutes walk from them."
1136,Quick and friendly service.
1137,Delivery is fast too.
1138,"The man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7, then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving (mean while there were boths open all around)."
1139,As we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were.
1140,Great Indian food and the service is incredible.
1141,The waiters were not attentive except that the bill turned up on the table before we were finished.
1142,"My wife and I always enjoy the young, not always well trained but nevertheless friendly, staff, all of whom have a story."
1143,"For the people who want great food plus great service, Roxy is a place to AVOID!"

1145,"The food is great, service is ok."
1146,Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there.
1147,The service was attentive.
1148,We visited Bread Bar during January restaurant week and were so pleased with the menu selections and service.
1149,"The wait staff is very friendly, if not overly efficient."
1150,Service has always been friendly and efficient.
1151,All we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner.
1152,The table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long overdue bottle of wine finally arrived.
1153,"We could not catch our waiter's eye, and he ignored us."
1154,They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends.
1155,"The waitress, seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing."
1156,"good music, great food, speedy service affordable prices."
1157,"May, the owner always has a smile on her and will warmly greet you."
1158,The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out.
1159,"Otherwise, this place has great service and prices and a nice friendly atmosphere."
1160,Highly recommend this as great value for excellent sushi and service.
1161,This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service.
1162,A++   The service was good to excellent along with the attitude.
1163,For the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated.
1164,The pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC.
1165,The Waitstaff were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal.
1166,"Terrible, terrible management - deserves to be shut-down."
1167,"Great friendly service, Fast seating, Fast Delivery, Excellent sushi."
1168,"The Italian food has flavor (that can be sort of surprising on the UES), and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive,they sort of remind me of the NY Yankees of the late 90's, no matter how bad it look, you knew that there was a rally just around the corner..."
1169,"As many other reviewers noticed, your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time."
1170,"Emilio, the owner, is often sitting in the front table greeting guests as they come and go."
1171,The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can.
1172,The waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal!
1173,"The ambience was nice, but service wasn't so great."
1174,"Solid wine list, knowledgeable staff, friendly owners and an adventurous, ever-changing menu keep us coming back."
1175,The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes.
1176,"We didn't even see a menu, as our waiter described both the specials and the main dishes."
1177,"Two people in our party felt like something else, and Volare immediately obliged with two great dishes that were not in their regular menu."
1178,He offers subpar service and has no personality.
1179,"The waitress remembers me and is very friendly, she knows what my regular is and that's the fried mini buns with the condensed milk and the assorted fruits on beancurd."
1180,The portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter.
1181,Our server was very helpful and friendly.
1182,While I'm not sure that this happens all the time-this is the kind of treatment that buys repeat business!
1183,"The second you walk through the heavy vault like door, with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime."
1184,Why make a reservation if you aren't going to keep it?
1185,I think the stuff was better than Disney.
1186,I had been searching really hard for a restaurant in New York where I could really feel unwanted and ignored and I finally found it!
1187,"Well, their deliveries take for ever and the food is usually cold."
1188,The staff is no nonsense.
1189,This is a great Thai restaurant with a very friendly staff.
1190,It took them 25 minutes to bring our appetizer.
1191,Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you're with.
1192,The restaurant is rather small but we were lucky to get a table quickly.
1193,"Oh yes, and they lie on the phone, claiming they have seating in the garden, then of course the seats are not available."
1194,Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat.
1195,It takes forever to get a drink and they almost always forget to bring something (although they dont forget to charge you for it.
1196,"Saturday, Nov. 6th I had a group from work come in with about 35 people and the staff was amazing to accomodate us."
1197,"First, the waiter who served us neglected to fill us in on the specials, which I would have chosen had I known about them."
1198,"Authentic food and they have REAL service, not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door."
1199,"I am amazed by the poor reviews- I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian- great prices, great atmosphere, good service and a wonderful wine list."
1200,I was back-to-back with the diner at the table behind me and wait staff had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again.
1201,"Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor."
1202,"The waitstaff were attentive, polite and helpful - an impressive feat in such close quarters."
1203,"Have always found that the waiters will go out of their way to be helpful, despite the fact they are often busy with lots of diners."
1204,The owner truly caters to all your needs.
1205,He takes real pride in his food and his business.
1206,I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere!
1207,"Service is not exactly five star, but thats not really a big deal."
1208,There are other people waiting!
1209,"While the ambiance and atmosphere were great, the food and service could have been a lot better."
1210,The server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile.
1211,I had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the service was rude an unattentive.
1212,"Super friendly and knowledgable staff, fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz (the chilaquiles were awesome!"
1213,"The table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the service industry, I understood they were busy."
1214,Nicky the Nose at the bar is a treat.
1215,"Service was prompt, friendly and great."
1216,"After all that, they complained to me about the small tip."
1217,"Whenever you need a Sushi fix, Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service."
1218,"Our waitress was sweet and accomodating, not overbearing."
1219,Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them.
1220,Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening.
1221,"Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated, we were served dishes we hadn't ordered three times, received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served (and that order was undercooked), and charged $45 more than we should have been on our bill."
1222,Service is top notch.
1223,Service was quick.
1224,Drawbacks: service is slow and they don't toast!
1225,"Upon entering, we were greeted by the owners, Steven and Frederick, who went out of their way to be more than gracious hosts."
1226,they bring service up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small dessert for our celebration.
1227,My first time there I happened not to like the Crab Croquette apt that i ordered and they were happy to change it for me without making no big deal.
1228,Great for large groups and celebrations - our SUPER HAPPY waiter was the entertainment of the evening.
1229,like saying her bread comes from a special bakery when we have seen her buying it dowtown manhathan.
1230,"However, in the summer of 2003, it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup."
1231,We were treated with attitude ever since the moment we stepped into the restaurant!
1232,Has the chef and owner changed???
1233,"Service was warm and attentive, beef carpaachio was exellent (huge portion) and pasta was fresh and well-prepared."
1234,"Great bar, most gorgeous bartenders you've ever seen (specifically the blond lady)."
1235,We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order.
1236,"I had a terrific meal, and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range, instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that wasn't as good."
1237,"The svc can be a bit rude at times, esp if you have big group, but overall the restaurant is a must!"
1238,The food is delicious and beautifully prepared along with the friendly and personable service.
1239,"After 2 tries by the waiter to take it away (we hadn't even looked at it yet, we had full beers yet to drink), the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations."
1240,We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh.
1241,"First the wrong bread came out with the appetizer, then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course..."
1242,Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square.
1243,"The crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly."
1244,"When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort."
1245,There is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times.
1246,"There was a long wait for a table outside, but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice."
1247,This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent.
1248,I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of.
1249,"It's a shame that a nice, convenient place like the Pink Pony can be so ruined by lousy service."
1250,"Friendly and informative staff, very attentive and prompt raw bar service."
1251,"We laughed when he finally offered us a dessert menu and we left a 10 percent tip, which was generous, I feel."
1252,The staff ignored my friends and I the entire time we were there.
1253,"Yet paired with such rude service, would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there."
1254,Delivery service is great too.
1255,I recieved prompt service with a smile.
1256,"If you go to Roth's try to be served by Mike, he is GREAT!!"
1257,"not the food ,not the ambiance , not the service, I agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait , the wait staff are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out ."
1258,"Nha Trang, while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor, horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals, is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been to. the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables."
1259,"On the other hand, if you are not fooled easily, you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse, and food that will outshine in presentaion, taste, choice, quality and quantity."
1260,"If I could rate the people this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza, sorry - not the best in NYC."
1261,"The portions are now very small, the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good, the restaurant, due to its popularity, seems frantic."
1262,"The owner is very friendly and a great guy, go try his pizza, you'll like it!"
1263,"With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care."
1264,The service is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the food arrives.
1265,"Not only is the cuisine the best around, the service has always been attentive and charming."
1266,"Waiters tend to forget drinks completely, food portions are so tiny, two people have trouble sharing one entree."
1267,"Interesting selection, good wines, service fine, fun decor."
1268,Any if you have a reservation you'll wait for max 5 minutes - so have a drink at the bar.
1269,"they didn't disappoint, service from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table."
1270,"The only positive was the wait staff, which was prompt, knowledgable, and likeable."
1271,"We have been to this place many times, and always have great food, wine, and service."
1272,"Haru serves very fresh fish, has a trendy, modern ambiance, prime location on Park Avenue South and friendly service."
1273,"The service is spotty, sometimes really friendly and sometimes barely there."
1274,"Great food, great prices, great service."
1275,"Told us to sit anywhere, and when we sat he said the table was reserved."
1276,In reality (to maximize potential diners) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby.
1277,"But when you are seated the waitresses are great, they explain everything on the menu, and the price of the food is really cheap for the service you get."
1278,"The freshest, best variety, and the fastest delivery."
1279,Go to Volare for 1st class service and terrific food.
1280,"It's super-trendy and there's always someone to take that empty seat, so it seems that customer service has been deemed not of the essence."
1281,We were well attended to by the enthusiastic staff especially the manager Tony Gaskin who made excellent suggestions for our menu selections.
1282,"still stay away, the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were serves eventhough they were there much longer..."

1301,"Meanwhile, the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil, gratis."
1302,Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting.
1303,The food was well prepared and the service impecable.
1304,Our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese.

1325,This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart's and I must say how delicous the food and the service was.
1326,"One would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby waiter wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so."
1327,"They brought glasses and the bottle, and just left the bottle at our table."
1328,"We actually gave 10% tip (which we have never done despite mediocre food and service), because we felt totally ripped off."
1329,"While we enjoyed the food, we were highly disappointed by the poor service (waiter was not quite competent and SLOW service) and lack of remorse."

1371,The service was ok.
1372,"When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude."

1377,"The staff are attentive, and have smiles on their faces."
1378,"Maybe I say so because it looked promising for people who like artery-clogging jewish deli food, but turns out to be poorly run and awful."
1379,After my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer.
1380,"When he's not making authentic Neapolitan pizza in the open brick oven or lightly frying zucchini blossoms, he's visiting the regulars (a growing legion) and checking on newcomers."

1412,Service was very good and warm.
1413,"Like others have said, don't expect the restaurant to make a nite out romantic for you and yes, a busy restaurant may require you to wait."
1414,"The service was a bit slow, but they were very friendly."
1415,"The people with carts of food don't understand you because they don't speak English, their job is to give you the delicious food you point at."
1416,We've never had any problems with the staff but maybe we've been lucky?
1417,The main downside to the place is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level.
1418,"The best part of the experience was knowing that the manager (a bubbly, friendly young woman with a great smile) truly cared about how we were doing."
1419,"However, service was as plain as sesame crusted Salmon I had."
1420,The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back.

1423,Waiters are slow but sweet.
1424,Rao's has the best service and atmosphere in NYC.

1426,"The kitchen however, is almost always slow."
1427,"Cute place, nice wait staff but would never go there again."
1428,"Also, the hostess called me today to thank us for coming and mentioned how she hoped that my girlfriend enjoyed her birthday - unexpected, but a truly above and beyond thing to do..."
1429,people are rude bit again it's new york!
1430,Service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great.

1440,"Everything, from the soft bread, soggy salad, and 50 minute wait time, with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average food."
1441,"The food was amazing, and the service was prompt and helpful, but not over-bearing or rushed."
1442,"(food was delivered by a busboy, not waiter) We got no cheese offered for the pasta, our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal, when we would have easily spent another $20 on wine."
1443,The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well.
1444,Everyone was more then happy with his choices.
1445,"Again, the waitress was awesome."
1446,The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals.
1447,Scalina Fedeli reminded me why service is so integral to fine dining.
1448,As soon as my father lifted his pen from the check a chef appeared to usher us out.
1449,The only disappointment was the coat check girls who didn't seem to know what a customer is on a realtively non-busy night (for the coat check girls).
1450,"We had great desserts (including the best cannoli I've ever had) and then they offered an after dinner drink, on the house."
1451,"We asked to be moved (which took half an hour), and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back, even though the rest of the room was practically empty."

1458,Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
1459,"Also, if you don't want to sit at a certain table, you don't have to!"
1460,"The staff isn't the friendliest or most competent, and I am stickler for service, but everything else about this place makes up for it."
1461,I've overheard comments from him to his employees that should not have been delivered in the dining area and I've been sitting there while he lectured another customer.
1462,I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna.
1463,Just bring someone who speaks Cantonese because waiter may not understand you.
1464,We had a party in their private room and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning.
1465,"i've noticed megadeth, mr. scruff, st. germain, traditional vietnamese songs, black sabbath, jay-z, and daft punk all being played."
1466,The design and atmosphere is just as good.
1467,"Secondly, on this night the place was overwhelmed by upper east side ladies perfume."

1485,It was tiny and I felt like I was eating in someone's living room.
1486,"Nice restaurant overall, with classic upscale Italian decor."
1487,"There's nice and quiet, small but enough for 6 (or more)."

1493,"Ambiance and music funky, which I enjoy."
1494,"I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic, alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods, the tastes, the experiance."
1495,"Eating in, the atmosphere saves it, but at your desk, it's a very disappointing experience."
1496,"Granted the space is smaller than most, it is the best service you will find in even the largest of restaurants."
1497,I love the atmorphere @ peep!
1498,It's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early.
1499,"The environment is romantic, but the food is horrible, the service is pathetic, and gabriella lies about everything she could."

1501,"The service, wine selection, ambiance are all outstanding and deserve recognition."
1502,"It is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no traffic noise."

1508,Always busy but fast moving.

1511,"The noise level was unbearable, conversation impossible."
1512,The atmosphere is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon.

1516,"When you're sitting in their main dining room (which has a spectacular, hand-painted high ceiling) you'd never know there was a world outside."

1537,Big and gawky on the outside.
1538,"While the $20 entree range is not overly expensive, in New York City, there is definitely better food in that range, and so Sapphire, despite it's lovely atmosphere, will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return."
1539,The photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real look.

1545,Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat.
1546,"The food was very good, a great deal, and the place its self was great."
1547,"Probably much busier for lunch, it's seldom crowded for dinner (too close to downtown)."
1548,The place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening.
1549,Check out the secret back room.
1550,"It's also attached to Angel's Share, which is a cool, more romantic bar..."
1551,"I am amazed by the poor reviews- I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian- great prices, great atmosphere, good service and a wonderful wine list."
1552,I was back-to-back with the diner at the table behind me and wait staff had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again.
1553,With the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room.
1554,"I was a little leary about Mary's at first - it's small, crowded and you usually have to wait on line - but I'm glad I finally tried it."
1555,The characters really make for an enjoyable experience.
1556,"The restuarant itself is not large, but seems to have several round tables to accomodate large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic Taiwanese."
1557,"It's constantly open, catering to the Pakistani cabbies lined up on Crosby St., so there's more turnover with the food than you'd expect (i.e., surprisingly fresh)."
1558,Great romantic place for a date (try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close!).
1559,If you don't mind all that noise then go to the Chart House.
1560,"So, if yo really don't care who is sittingnext to you, which is about 2 inches away, I would say try it."
1561,"Aside from the bearded, courdoroy blazer professor type with the NYU student he's sleeping with that week, you see a strange mix of hipsters, frat boys, Will Smith types who need to be told they are black, bitter cougars who cant understand why they arent married yet...."
1562,"While the ambiance and atmosphere were great, the food and service could have been a lot better."
1563,I had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the service was rude an unattentive.
1564,"We recently decided to try this location, and to our delight, they have outdoor seating, perfect since I had my yorkie with me."
1565,The food is usually good but it certainly isn't a relaxing place to go.
1566,"Super friendly and knowledgable staff, fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz (the chilaquiles were awesome!"
1567,"Even though it is a little loud, you don't have to yell at each other to talk."
1568,It is kinda nosiy and the tables are close together but it's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner.
1569,"Behind this counter, two men are squeezed in."
1570,The website and rating makes this place look wonderful but in reality it was very disappointing.
1571,The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful.
1572,"The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall, which are great for a date."
1573,It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects.
1574,Now it's so crowded and loud you can't even talk to the person next to you.
1575,"However, in the summer of 2003, it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup."
1576,It's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street.
1577,"After dinner, take your date to the HUGE dance floor, probably one of the biggest you'll see in NY."
1578,"I found it on a cold night, the perfect spot to warm up."
1579,Located at the end of a magnificent block.
1580,"Looking around, I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant, not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen."
1581,They don't walk around with the trays of Dim Sum.
1582,We had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar food was just what we were looking for.
1583,"Not sure where the previous reviewer, lonk, dined, but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food!"
1584,There is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times.
1585,Don't waste money on decor.
1586,They also have a back garden open in the summer - cute and French with outdoor seating - what more could you ask for?
1587,"Given the incredible architecture surrounding it, this place has no character."
1588,"While the place is not a hotspot hangout, the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck."
1589,"It's a shame that a nice, convenient place like the Pink Pony can be so ruined by lousy service."
1590,"The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music, and moreover, takes requests."
1591,The place was quiet and delightful.
1592,The prices and ambience are especially great considering it's in the West Village.
1593,"Nha Trang, while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor, horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals, is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been to. the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables."
1594,"On the other hand, if you are not fooled easily, you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse, and food that will outshine in presentaion, taste, choice, quality and quantity."
1595,The atmosphere is great!!!
1596,"It can be a very fun experience with a group, and kids (6 and over) would love it."
1597,"The atmosphere isn't the greatest , but I suppose that's how they keep the prices down ."
1598,"Filled with suits, though, so you never really feel terribly comfortable."
1599,"It's like you are transported to the Italian countryside, very romantic and filled with antiques."
1600,"Interesting selection, good wines, service fine, fun decor."
1601,But the thing that my wife and I hated was it was so loud and it felt like 'bar' or 'pub'.
1602,I don't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer.
1603,I was very impressed by this low-key upper eastsider and their authentically thai cuisine!!!
1604,"Haru serves very fresh fish, has a trendy, modern ambiance, prime location on Park Avenue South and friendly service."
1605,Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months.
1606,"Very romantic fires - I've literally spent hours at Lanterna, drinking wine from their extensive wine and enjoying the ambience."
1607,"Always a nice crowd, but never loud."
1608,Decor is minimalist and clean - nothing to distract or commend.
1609,"This place, however, has a lot less pretension than Joya and the Thai food is still above-average."
1610,This place is incredibly tiny.
1611,"I didn't complain, I liked the atmosphere so much."
1612,"It's super-trendy and there's always someone to take that empty seat, so it seems that customer service has been deemed not of the essence."
1613,The people in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud.
1614,I was with a party of 7 (close but not next the the front doors) and we were eating with our coats on.
1615,"A very inviting restaurant, with friendly service."
1616,"THe back garden sitting area is very pleasant, where you can see their personal herb garden."
1617,The ceiling is amazing!
1618,"The space is a bit too small for live music, so on  jazz nights, it can be loud and cramped."
1619,Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment.
1620,Oh and it's too tiny for families with strollers.
1621,Delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door.
1622,"Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm, but the open kitchen is part of the charm."
1623,"THR AT MOSHPHERE IS COMPACT, MODERN, YET COZY."
1624,"Decent Thai food in cute - though a bit dank - little Nolita hangout, BUT service terrible."
1625,"Most people eat there seem to be typical Upper East Side snobs, so be aware."
1626,Too cold to enjoy.
1627,"Inside is a little cramped, but to be expected."
1628,"So, for good food i'd recommend it, but not for a fun night out."
1629,"Of course, it is crowded but who cares."
1630,"Chance is a small cozy restaurant, with a romantic feel to it, the decor is great."
1631,People dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans.
1632,"The place does get crowded, so I recommend going between 4-5 PM."
1633,"Good, dark atmosphere and the music is a nice touch."
1634,"Great for groups, great for a date, great for early brunch or a nightcap."
1635,Authentic Shanghai style and I cannot recommend a better Shanghai place in New York.
1636,"Because we didn't have a reservation, we could only sit in the back garden, but it was great, secluded and perfect in nice weather."
1637,Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant.
1638,"The signs, the specials menus, food, and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese."
1639,"It is about FOOD and Ambiance, and imagine how dreadful it will be it we only had to listen to an idle engine."
1640,The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing!
1641,"Great food, great lay out and awesome service."
1642,I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan.
1643,"The food was amazing, the service was so attentive and personable, and how about that ambience!"
1644,"This place has the best interior I have seen anywhere in the northside of W'burg, and will impress whoever you bring there."
1645,"And forget what you read under me, the atmosphere isn't that bad either."
1646,"It's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre food, noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks."
1647,"Although the place could be a little more eye catching and roomier, at the same time, it doesn't really matter."
1648,You can barely see who you are with never mind have a conversation.
1649,"We ate out in the back patio, which is worth it as it's cool and the music is hear well there."
1650,The location is perfect.
1651,"While I quite liked the food and the ambience, I'm not quite sure if it they really deserve it the Michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window."
1652,The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
1653,And I say snacking because it really is not set up to be a proper dinner.
1654,The quality of food at this restaurant accompanied  by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10!
1655,"If your visiting, you'll enjoy the ambiance and the fact that it's in Time Sq..."
1656,LOVE the atmosphere - felt like I was in Paris.
1657,"Spice is sleek, modern and cool with a menu that will not hurt your wallet."
1658,Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff.
1659,Very affordable and excellent ambient!
1660,Its a go-to for dates as well as entertaining out of town guests.
1661,Why do people rave about the ambience.
1662,The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance.
1663,"Although the tables may be closely situated, the candle-light, food-quality and service overcompensate."
1664,The place was real empty but that was because this was the first Sunday they ever opened.
1665,This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money.
1666,"Ambience is delightful, service impeccable."
1667,"Service was excellent, and the AC worked very well too (thank God, it was hot!)."
1668,"The staff was accomodating, the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely."
1669,Great atmoshere and worth every bit.
1670,"Excellent atmosphere, delicious dishes good and friendly service."
1671,A cool place to hang with your friends for a couple of healthy drinks and desserts.
1672,"Great vibe, lots of people."
1673,"Either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th."
1674,"A cool bar with great food, and tons of excellent beer."
1675,The ambience is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt service.
1676,"Great food (spinach and corn dumplings and massamman curry), very friendly and no nonsense service and a clean and funky bathroom."
1677,Romantic if you want it to be (brightly lit).
1678,"Even though I made the reservation at 3pm for the same night through Dinnerbroker, we were seated at a table with one of the best view!"
1679,The red sliding doors may be unique but they do not block off the cold air from the outside.
1680,In summer-eat outside on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!
1681,"It's the perfect restaurant for NY life style, it got cool design, awsome drinks and food and lot's of good looking people eating and hanging at the pink bar..."
1682,"To dine at Thalia can be slightly deceiving because while its beautiful on the outside, its so bland on the inside."
1683,"It's charmingly small and that leads to an atmoshere that is extremely cozy and romantic, even."
1684,Love the Jazz bands on Fri and Sat.
1685,"Don't expect to sit down inside though, there are only a few tables and they are always full."
1686,"The staff is accomodating, the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed, and the food is out of this world!"
1687,"This place is cool enough to be in the East Village, but French enough to make you feel like you could be in a bistro in a back alley in Paris."
1688,"No dress codes, no attitudes, plenty of comfort companionship, a great place to relax in an always busy Midtown."
1689,"This was the perfect quiet, relaxing, and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater."
1690,"The decor is really blah, and not at all hip or happening."
1691,"Having discovered Ping's on the internet, we entered with qualms but were instantly put to ease by the fish tanks that greet you as u walk in."
1692,"Just don't take the seat between the bar and the back half of the restaurant, i saw a woman get nudged 40times sitting there."
1693,"To me it exemplifies Soho, cute, artsy, interesting."
1694,"at night, but it's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the music playing in the background is also voluminous."
1695,"We made early dinner reservations and were thoroughly impressed, reminds me of my grandfather, its old school Italian scenery with lots of fun stuff to admire."
1696,The place was nice and calm.
1697,"The service was poor, restaurant poorly lit, staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald's than this joint."
1698,"For myself and family we would only go here to celebrate an occassion, I do prefer smaller, quiter restaurants."
1699,"My GF and I still choose to eat there a lot because of diverse cocktails, the chill decor, and the decent sushi."
1700,"Once you step into Cosette, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro."
1701,There is a real gallery of stars that have visited.
1702,"The food was below average, the service was pathetic, there was no ambience at all."
1703,I REALLY ENJOYED THE SHOWS PUT ON BY THE ACTORS.
1704,"Toons has recently been redone, so it's now a very attractive space."
1705,"Its a nice quiet location to go eat a good meal, relax, be able to talk and have a very good time."
1706,"However, I think this place is a good hang out spot."
1707,"When we left at 8:00 PM, it was packed and noisy."
1708,Decor is nice though service can be spotty.
1709,And even with it's Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too!
1710,Really cool stauff inside.
1711,"While the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made Tiffin so attractive, the menu has been overhauled."
1712,"The blond wood decor is very soothing, the premium sake is excellent and the service is great."
1713,"Of course this atmosphere is lacking, but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel place anyways?"
1714,Cornelia Street looks like a Broadway set for West Side Story and the inside of Po is so cool quaint you really can't top the setting for a romantic dinner in NYC.
1715,"Like others have said, don't expect the restaurant to make a nite out romantic for you and yes, a busy restaurant may require you to wait."
1716,Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went.
1717,"The food is decent at best, and the ambience, well, it's a matter of opinion, some may consider it to be a sweet thing, I thought it was just annoying."
1718,It's a small cute restaurant.
1719,"Leon is an East Village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic French bistro fare, good specials, a warm and lively atmosphere."
1720,Restaurant was dirty and unkempt.
1721,It is a small restuarant so go early and it will be nice and quiet- go late and it will be packed!
1722,"This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets, with that certain Parisian flair."
1723,"Great roofdeck, nice group of 30 somethings, but no music, kind of quiet."
1724,"You get what you pay for and with that logic in mind, Spice is a great place to grab some cheap eats and drinks in a beautiful setting."
1725,"Other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced, the atmosphere is filled with energy (and the beautiful people of course) and the food was surprising good!"
1726,The music is the best among all the Indian restaurants I have visited.
1727,Rao's has the best service and atmosphere in NYC.
1728,"Excellent dumplings served amid clean, chic decor."
1729,"Cute place, nice wait staff but would never go there again."
1730,Service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great.
1731,"Everything is excellent, the menu is quite extensive, and you eat with a view on both sides of the city."
1732,Here's to the fake fish tanks too...
1733,"The first time I went, and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere, I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad."
1734,we decided to eat in tea room which was small and cute.
1735,"The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative."
1736,"Everything is always cooked to perfection, the service is excellent, the decor cool and understated."
1737,If you've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer.
1738,Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant.
1739,Total hipster-wannabe attitude in an otherwise sweet spot.
1740,Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
1741,This is definitely an  excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the  night scene is more than alive.
1742,I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors.
1743,Zero ambiance to boot.
1744,Got a little loud after 8pm when the joint got full.
1745,"Everything looks great, the drinks, the decor, the food, even the people."
1746,"It is sometimes a little cramped, and can get a little warm, but hello, it's NYC!"
1747,"Good crowd, good outdoor seating, with a hip japanese vibe."
1748,"However, their popularity has yet to slow down, and I still find myself drawn to their ambiance and delectable reputation."
1749,"Where tanks in other Chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters, the tanks at Ping's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover's brunch."
1750,"The view is spectacular, and the food is great."
1751,"The place wasn't too hard to find, but it was kind of packed, as soon as my boyfriend and I got our food, the line reached the door."
1752,A bit breezy up there on the mezzanine from the wind coming from the tracks.
1753,I LOVED THE SHOWS.
1754,The aesthetics of this place are like an airport lounge.
1755,The pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere.
1756,"However, go for the ambience, and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world!"
1757,I think the restaurant was too loud (when full) to be romantic.
1758,"Always popular, always full, always a wait."
1759,A little noise but I think that was because of our party!
1760,"I can't wait for summer, when they serve outside on their gigantic patio."
1761,"It cannot be the ambience, because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle."
1762,"The eggplant parmesan is also great, and my friend who grew up in Manhattan claims that no one serves a better baked ziti with meatsauce."
1763,"Quality ingredients preparation all around, and a very fair price for NYC."
1764,"My entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid, and was unnecessarily heated with a burner."
1765,We began with the cheese fondue (the artisanal blend) and added apples and kielbasa to dip.
1766,"Its not curry in a slurry crap, and regular run of the mill food."
1767,"In fact, while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu, and I couldn't help telling them that the food was horrible."
1768,"If you want Americanized Chinese food with your usual watery, generic white sauce, this is your place."
1769,"The bread is the soft paratha bread (unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta), and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful."
1770,"Service is friendly, prices are good - delivery time was a little slow, but for the way this pizza tastes, I'm willing to overlook it."
1771,The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don't like.
1772,"The service is excellent, the decor is great, and the food is delicious and comes in large portions."
1773,"The food however, is what one might expect."
1774,I LOVE their Thai noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST!
1775,The pizza was really good.
1776,"Food is average, and I would say even the chain restaurant Baluchi's tastes better."
1777,The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic.
1778,The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate.
1779,Kosher dills are the perfect compliment for your unforgetable sandwich and they give you plenty of them.
1780,The food there is so good that even to order out the wait is incredible.
1781,"Their sushi, Kamikaze and other Rolls are fresh and well presented."
1782,"For authentic Thai food, look no further than Toons."
1783,"The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries I received from one of the food runners, which is not good considering the bill was nearly $100."
1784,"I choose to go with one of the special, the braised lamb shank in red wine, which was excellent."
1785,"If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines,please check their wine list."
1786,Have the iced tea.
1787,"Small servings for main entree, i had salmon (wasnt impressed) girlfriend had chicken, it was good."
1788,you can actually get 2 salads worth if u take it home and add it to some lettuce!
1789,"The food is very good for it's price, better than most fried dumplings I've had."
1790,Obv caviar is top of the line but the rest of the menu is so diverse it gives you a chance to taste so manydifferent varietys.
1791,I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive.
1792,"Everything is delicious, though, my gf and I come here once a week sometimes- you will get addicted!"
1793,"Other guests enjoyed pizza, santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips."
1794,Stay away from the latter since you won't go for seconds (hint hint).
1795,"not only does make the best pizza in NY , maybe anywhere."
1796,The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I've had at this price range.
1797,Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit.
1798,The place is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere.
1799,This is one of the best comfort food places in the city.
1800,"Overall, the ingredients and technique are there and I am encouraged enough to return at lunch or dinner to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves."
1801,I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll.
1802,The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale.
1803,"Considering their price of $6.25 for lunch special, the dish was ridiculously small."
1804,This is the pinnacle of Indian Fast Food (all fast foods in my opinion).
1805,The wine list is also really nice.
1806,"Service was devine, oysters where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat!!!"
1807,"Compared to Ess-a, Tal offers a less doughy bagel!"
1808,Ballato's is consistently delicious authentic italian food.
1809,They offer the same menu but have creative drinks that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names -- but they do cost you.
1810,We went to eat at the Jekyll and Hyde restaurant on Friday night and really enjoyed the fun atmosphere and good food.
1811,The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions.
1812,"I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal."
1813,"After we got our sashimi order, I could not believe how small the portions were!"
1814,"The dosas are skimpy, unattractive and drip with grease, and personally I'd drink popcorn topping before I'd eat another one of these."
1815,The service was excellent and the food was delicious.
1816,always fresh and delicious.
1817,"The food was very good, but not very thai."
1818,"Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you, but the food doesn't quite match up."
1819,The fillings may be unconventional but the dosa batter is definitely authentic and the combinations very tasty.
1820,"The mussaman curry that I ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that I ordered in it, they graciously provided me with ONE piece of poorly cooked potato."
1821,A restaurant that doesn't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere.
1822,Their sake martini is wonderful.
1823,"Bagels are ok, but be sure not to make any special requests!"
1824,fine dining restaurant quality.
1825,The food was exceptional.
1826,The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that.
1827,"The service is friendly, if not the most prompt in the world, the food is great, and the prices, while not cheap, won't put your wallet out of commission."
1828,"Had 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the bill was ~$55.00, not including tip."
1829,Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town!
1830,Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.
1831,Their whitefish salad is excellent--all whitefish with a little mayo.
1832,"The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry, inedible chicken with terrible sauce."
1833,"You can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience, but for superb food at reasonable prices, La Villa can't be beat."
1834,"The red curry is weak and tasteless, the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy, the rice is often overcooked, and the seafood is pretty sketchy."
1835,The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.
1836,"Saul is pretty good, but definitely not great."
1837,"I would recommend Roxy's for that, but not for their food."
1838,Their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic.
1839,"The puke green walls leave a lot to be desired, but the food is very good."
1840,"The flavors are very fresh and pretty inobtrusive, nothing flashy."
1841,The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed.
1842,big and soft as well as good lunch food.
1843,"No food snobs allowed, this place is for people who appreciate good food."
1844,I liked the food at this quasi-thai restaurant.
1845,By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant.
1846,"As for the bar, this is another bad idea."
1847,"Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience."
1848,"Unlike HH up the block, this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels this town is known for."
1849,The barebecued salmon is elegantly spiced and not at all dry.
1850,What generous portions!
1851,The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese (gets a little messy).
1852,The wine the service was very good too.
1853,"So, the menu is written in chalk above your head and it all sounds delicious."
1854,The highly spiced chai tea was great too.
1855,"I have been there many times, and food is good and consistent."
1856,"Seriously, this is the best all you can eat in town- As everyone says, the Spicy Tuna hand rolls are the best- have 4 of these, and you've broken even."
1857,"While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance, and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City, the food was not what I had hoped for."
1858,The meat dishes were only so-so.
1859,"The menu consisted of standard brassiere food, better then places like Balthazar etc."
1860,"I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village, and while I do believe their food has slightly slipped in quality, I have been hesitant to be disloyal."
1861,And you're hungry a few hours later.
1862,"You don't go to Mizu for excellent service, you go for the large amounts of food, the amiable atmosphere, and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place."
1863,This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down.
1864,Great value for the quality ingredients.
1865,"The Thali was small, thoroughly unremarkable, and $14.95."
1866,The sushi is also great!
1867,From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I can't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing.
1868,"The food here is rather good, but only if you like to wait for it."
1869,I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries.
1870,The makhani was OK --the korma was bland.
1871,The food is inventive but still keeps traditional indian flavoring.

2175,The atmosphere is much better than Sripraphai (more modern and sleek).
2176,"Anyhow, we were able to sit as long as we wanted and chat, which was nice."
2177,PERFECT FOR DATES!
2178,"The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual lunch here would probably be best."
2179,"We love the food, drinks, and atmosphere!"
2180,"The vibe is very relaxed and cozy, service was great and the food was excellent!"
2181,"If the weather is nice, try to snag an outside table."
2182,The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual.
2183,20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our surroundings and each other.
2184,"Forget the rush and the wait and the noise (which isn't actually that bad), I mean please, who goes to a steakhouse to be coddled and romantic?"
2185,Jimmy's is hands down the hottest night spot in the Bronx.
2186,"Nice ambiance, nice little bar, good bartender, Francois, and good service."
2187,Decor leaves something to be desired.
2188,"Our waiter was fine, the place looks nice in that not-trying-too-hard way, but at those prices, a little more should be expected of your food."
2189,"Oh yes, and if you are a fan of Indian oldies film stars, there are plenty of portraits of Indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls, some of which, I would love to know where they obtained."
2190,The space is nice but when we order our drink we were in for a surprise.
2191,The entire place and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt.
2192,I in all reality felt as if I had just gotten off Air France and was in the 8th District in Paris.
2193,"The staff was very attentive, the ambience lovely, and the food superb."
2194,THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too--but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area.
2195,"Warm, comfortable surroundings, nice appointments (witness the etched glass and brickwork separating the dining rooms)."
2196,"This is such a lovely, peaceful place to eat outside."
2197,"This is a great place to take out-of-towners, and perfect for watching the sunset."
2198,"You will pay a lot for the decore, but the food is no better or worse than a lot of other Chinese and Asian fusion places in NY."
2199,I care more about the food and ambience.
